# Black bean chocolate cake
(Gluten free, grain free)

This is my go-to for easily accommodating a guest or birthday kid with celiac. Sometimes I reduce the sugar a bit and add protein powder to make it a breakfast for myself (but this can be hit or miss).

## Ingredients

* 2 cups cooked and drained black beans (or yield from a scant 1 cup dry; canned is fine)
* 5 large eggs
* 0.75 cup brown sugar
* 6 tbsp coconut oil, butter, or other oil that's soft but solid at room temperature
* 6 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 0.5 tsp baking soda

## Method

1. Blend all ingredients together in a food processor until smooth and aerated
1. Pour into prepared 9" round pan (lined/greased)
1. Bake at 350F until it passes the toothpick test

## Notes

* Better after keeping overnight in an airtight container, otherwise can be a bit dry and crumbly
* If you want to make it light with some fancy cake-making tricks:
    1. Puree the beans with the egg yolks and mix in 1 tsp xanthan gum, plus remaining dry ingredients
    1. Cream the fat and sugar thoroughly and mix in the beans/yolks
    1. Whip the egg whites separately into a foam and fold it gently into the batter
