# Super Simple Apple Tart

## Ingredients

* 1 package frozen puff pastry. I said this was super simple.
* 2 or 3 apples. I usually use Granny Smiths and Honeycrisps.
* A lemon for juice.
* 1/2 cup brown sugar. I like dark brown sugar but golden is fine.
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt.
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon.
* 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Rum extract would probably work well too.
* 1 tbsp of butter, melted.
* Optional confectioner's sugar for topping.

# Instructions

1. Start defrosting the puff pastry. Put it on a baking sheet with either nonstick paper or (better) parchment paper. Don't let it get too defrosted, you want it just thawed enough to unfold, but not enough to be mushy. You can stick it back in the freezer if you have to. Start preheating the oven to 415F.
2. Core the apples, then slice as thin as you can (a mandolin would help). I don't bother to peel them.
3. Throw the slices into a bowl, then squeeze the lemon juice onto them and gently toss the slices so they all get coated. They're going to be nice and wet and delicious.
4. Add the brown sugar, salt, cinnamon and the vanilla extract, then mix gently until all the apple slices are coated.
5. Melt the butter, then brush it over the rectangular pieces of pastry dough.
6. Lay the apple slices over the dough, overlapping each slice. Eat the leftover slices.
7. Brush more melted butter over the apple slices.
8. Bake at 415F for 18-20 minutes. Bake them long enough for the pastry to puff, and sometimes that doesn't happen until the last couple of minutes.
9. If you're using confectioner's sugar, sprinkle it on while the tarts are still hot.

They're going to be oozing hot sugary liquid, so once they're out of the oven move them to a cooling rack so they don't stick to the pan. Parchment paper instead of cooking spray is a big win here.

Serve with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream.
