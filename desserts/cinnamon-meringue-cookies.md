# Cinnamon Meringue Cookies

## Ingredients:

3 large egg whites
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp cream of tartar
3/4 cup sugar

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 200F
2. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper
3. Add egg whites, vanilla extract, cinnamon and cream of tartar to stand mixer
4. Using the whisk attachment, whip egg mixture till frothy and forming soft peaks.
5. Gradually add sugar, 1 tbsp at a time. Wait 30-45 seconds between sugar additions. If you add it too fast, your meringues will have a grainy texture.
6. Once all the sugar has been added, whip at high speed for 7 minutes until the egg mixture is glossy and stiff but not dry
7. Spoon mixture into a large pastry bag with a star tip. You can make do with a ziplock bag with a corner cut off but your cookies will look deconstructed. Pip two inch cookies onto the sheets, 1 inch apart. Be consistent about cookie size or they will not cook evenly
8. Bake for 45 minutes at 200F, then turn off the oven for another 45 minutes. Remove and cool completely before storing in an airtight container.

## Variant Options:

Omit the cinnamon, and sub in almond extract, rum, whiskey or bourbon for the vanilla extract.
