# Delicious Scrambled Eggs

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 tablespoon tabasco sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried dill weed
- 1 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper flakes
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup 4 alarm cheese


# INSTRUCTIONS

- In a medium bowl, whisk eggs until consistent and season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and dill weed.  Add 1 tablespoon of tabasco sauce (note: the heat will dissipate after cooking, but the flavor will remain) and stir.
- Grate 4 alarm cheese, store it in an accessible location.  Keep butter stick next to cheese.
- Warm skillet to high heat, add butter to prevent sticking. 
- Before the butter begins to burn, add eggs.  Let sit for 10-15 seconds, then stir with spatula for up to 1min 30s to prevent burning.
- As the eggs are nearing the desired temperature, add the 4-alarm cheese and a small amount of butter.  Continue stirring until eggs are cooked and cheese has melted.


Serve with fresh avocado.
