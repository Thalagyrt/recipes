# Habanero and Pineapple Hot Sauce

## Equipment
- food processor/blender
- seive (optional)
- storage bottle/jar(s) for finished product (produces 2.5 cups/600ml), filled with boiling water to sanitize
- saucepan and heat source
- spoon


## Ingredients
    
   - 2 to 6 habaneros (depending on how hot you want it) - For bonus flavour ferment the habaneros in brine for at least a week, push them down beneath the water line with a ramekin or small bag filled with water - use non iodized salt.
   - 1 to 2 limes, juiced
   - 1 cup (240ml) white distilled vinegar
   - 2 cups (450g) fresh (or tinned, I'm not the police) pineapple
   - 1 teaspoon kosker/sea/himalayan pink salt (plus a pinch more for balancing at the end)
   - 1 teaspoon granulated/white sugar (for balancing at the end)

## Directions
1. Blitz all ingredients in a food processor to achieve desired consistency (you can strain it before bottling at the end to make it more of a liquid). [Thermomix Speed 5, 5 seconds, scrape, repeat]
2. Throw it all into a saucepan and heat on a low heat, just so it's bubbling a little for 15 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking/burning. [Thermomix 100 C, Speed 1, 15 minutes]
3. At the end of the heating taste it and balance out as desired with salt and sugar.
4. Empty the storage bottle/jar of the boiled water (should still be hot and have sat at least 3 minutes) and pour in the sauce. Leave to cool and refrigerate. Should keep upwards of a month due to the pH.
