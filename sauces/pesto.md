# Fresh Pesto

## INGREDIENTS
- 2 cups packed fresh basil leaves
- 2 large garlic cloves
- 1/2 cup pine nuts (toasted if desired)
- 3/4 cup freshly grated parmesan
- 2/3 cup olive oil

## Directions
In food processor, finely chop garlic and pine nuts, then add basil leaves with a little oil. Process until smooth. Add parmesan and remaining oil.

(If you are not using right away, reserve a little bit of oil, put pesto in a small container - i use artichoke heart jars - and cover with the reserved oil. this will keep it from turning dark. Stir in to serve.)
