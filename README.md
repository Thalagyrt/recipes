# Recipes

A collection of things I've cooked or want to cook. PRs welcome!

If you want to add a recipe but don't know how to make a pull request, just post your recipe in the issues section and I'll format and add it!

These have been collected over various years and I don't know the sources for them. If one of these recipes is yours and you would like attribution, please feel free to PR it up!
