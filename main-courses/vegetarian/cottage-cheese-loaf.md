# Cottage Cheese "Meatloaf"

Source: [Allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25908/cottage-cheese-roast/)

This recipe is a decent source of vegetarian protein and is really good for using up a lot of cottage cheese, like when you get a Costco-sized pack and get sick of eating it plain halfway through.

## Ingredients

* 16 oz container cottage cheese (more or less)
* 4 large eggs
* 0.25 cup vegetable oil
* 2 Tbsp dry onion soup mix
* 1 cup finely chopped walnuts (try pulsing in a food processor)
* 1.5 cups cornflakes, crushed
* Optional but gives you that "straight from the childhood" feeling: 0.5 cup tomato ketchup

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and grease/line a 4" x 8" loaf tin
1. Thoroughly combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and pour mixture into tin
1. Bake until set, about 40 minutes
1. Optional: unmould loaf onto a baking sheet, glaze with 0.5 cup tomato ketchup, and broil for 5 to 7 minutes.

## Notes
* You can sub in other unsweetened cereals or grains for the cornflakes
* If you have odds and ends of vegetables, shred them up and mix them in here too (but you may need to add extra egg or cereal to bind it)
