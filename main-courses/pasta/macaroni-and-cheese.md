# Martha's Mac
The core of this recipe originally comes from *[Martha Stewart Living Cookbook: The Original Classics](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0307393828)* by way of the [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/05/marthas-macaroni-and-cheese/) blog. I've omitted the bread filler, halved the cheese sauce, and added a panko crust and green onion garnish ~~blatantly copied from~~ inspired by the San Francisco restaurant [Mac Daddy](https://macdaddysf.com).

## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 tablespoons AP flour
- 2 ¾ cups milk
- fresh nutmeg
- black pepper
- cayenne pepper
- 9 oz cheddar, as sharp as you can get, grated
- 4 oz Gruyère, grated
- additional grated cheese of your preference to top
- panko
- 1 lb pasta in your favorite sauce-grabbing shape; elbow macaroni is the classic choice, I like small shells.
- green onions, sliced thin for garnish

## Instructions
- Cook pasta almost according to package directions, but take it off the heat a minute or two early. It'll finish cooking in the oven.
- While the pasta is cooking, make a cheese sauce:
  - Melt butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat.
  - Add flour, whisking constantly to combine fully. You have now made a white roux.
  - Still whisking: slowly add the milk, a little at a time, until you've overwhelmed the roux's ability to absorb moisture and your béchamel sauce has achieved the correct consistency.
  - Whisk in fresh-grated nutmeg, fresh-ground pepper, and cayenne pepper (use a light hand on the cayenne unless you're really trying for a spicy dish here) to taste.
  - Kill the heat. Dump in your huge pile of cheese you've grated yourself and whisk until fully combined.
- In a greased casserole dish, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce. Make sure all the pasta is nicely coated.
- Cover the cheesy pasta mixture with the cheese you've reserved for crust.
- Cover _that_ with the panko.
- Bake the whole thing at 375 degrees F until golden brown, about half an hour.
- Let cool for a few minutes.
- Serve, garnishing with the sliced green onions.
