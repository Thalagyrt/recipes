INSTRUCTIONS

- Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package instructions. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water.
- In a large bowl, toss together pasta, vegetables, and red pepper flakes.
- Fold in ricotta, parmesan, lemon juice, and lemon zest. To thin the sauce, gradually add more cooking water. Taste and adjust seasoning to your preference.
