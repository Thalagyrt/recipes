# Lemon Herb Chicken

## Ingredients

- 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 3 tablespoons butter
- salt and pepper to taste
- Italian seasoning
- 1 cup uncooked rice (white or brown)
- 2 1/2 cups chicken broth (optional low sodium)
- juice of 1 lemon

# Instructions

- Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or pan (one that has a lid). Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste, and Italian seasoning. Brown chicken in the butter for 1-2 minutes on each side. (Chicken shouldn't be cooked through at this point) Transfer chicken to a plate.
- Add rice, chicken broth, lemon juice, and remaining Italian seasoning to the pan (no need to clean it first).
- Place chicken on top, then cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 40-45 minutes until liquid is dissolved. Cooking time may vary, so check on it at 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 35, 40, etc.
Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro if desired and lemon wedges for squeezing. Serve immediately.
