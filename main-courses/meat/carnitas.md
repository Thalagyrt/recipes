- Fry your pork in batches until it's golden brown and crispy. NOTE: under-do this part for the batch you are planning on freezing - defrost and re-fry to reheat

### Taco Directions
- Put the following in bowls:
Carnitas
Guacamole - pico de gallo should be added to avocados along with salt, pepper, and a bit of lime juice (about heaping tbsp pico per avocado)
Black beans - from a can is fine
some pico de gallo should be reserved and added to the tacos
cojita cheese, crumbled

- If you have taco holders, set them out. otherwise, string a line in your kitchen from which to hang your tacos. it should be relatively level so they don't slide around.
- Heat a skillet with some frying oil (i use avocado oil)
- Fry your tortillas on high heat until they are lightly browned. Optionally, add some cheese to melt after flipping
- pat dry and either place in taco forms or hang over line so that they keep the correct shape when they crisp

- Once your tortillas have crisped up, you can either assemble the tacos yourself or put all of the ingredients in small bowls and make your guests do the legwork. Enjoy
