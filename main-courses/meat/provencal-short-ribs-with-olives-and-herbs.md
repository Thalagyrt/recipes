by Melissa Roberts Gourmet December 2011
Makes 6 servings

## Ingredients
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- Salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 5 pounds short ribs (not cross-cut flanken)
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 medium red onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 celery rib, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 3 large garlic cloves, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 2 cups full-bodied red wine, such as Côtes du Rhône or Bordeaux
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 (15-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes in juice
- 3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2/3 cup (3 1/2 ounces) pitted kalamata olives, rinsed and patted dry
- 1 navel orange

## Preparation
- Heat oven to 350°F with rack in lower third.
- Stir together flour with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Pat ribs dry and lightly dredge in flour mixture, knocking off excess.
- Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Brown ribs in 3 batches, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer as browned to a platter. Discard fat from pot.
- Cook onions, carrots, and celery in remaining 2 tablespoons oil with 1/2 teaspoon salt over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just softened and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
- Add garlic and herbs and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened and fragrant, 2 minutes.
- Add wine and boil until reduced by half, about 8 minutes, then stir in broth, tomatoes with juice, and vinegar and bring to a simmer.
- Return ribs to pot. Cover with the lid, then place in oven, and braise until ribs are fork-tender, 3 to 3 1/4 hours.
- Transfer ribs with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Let cooking liquid stand briefly, then skim fat from top. Stir in olives. Adjust seasoning to taste, if necessary.
- Return meat to pot. Grate zest from orange over top just before serving.

## Crock Pot Variation
Reduce wine to 1 cup, broth to 1 cup, vinegar to ¼ cup. Follow steps 1 through 6, then place in crock pot and cook for 3-4 hours on high, 6-7 hours on low.
