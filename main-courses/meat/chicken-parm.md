# Chicken Parmigiana

## INGREDIENTS

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1/4 tsp salt
- big pinch pepper
- 2 eggs
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter

For serving:
- Fettuccine, cooked
- Sauce of your choice

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In three separate shallow bowls, like a pie plate, pour the flour in one plate, the egg, salt, and olive oil beaten together in another plate, and the parmesan-bread crumb mixture in another plate.
2. Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper on both sides. One breast at a time, roll them in the flour and shake off excess. Dip in beaten egg mixture. Then roll in the cheese and bread mixture.
3. Lay the chicken on a baking sheet thatâ€™s covered in wax paper and all the cheese and bread mixture to set for at least 10-15 minutes or for several hours.
4. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
5. Saute the chicken on both sides in butter, for about 3-5 minutes until a nice crispy, golden brown crust forms and transfer to a baking dish.
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until cooked all the way through using a meat thermometer.
