# Irish Stew

Some people feel passionate about what should/shouldn’t go in it, but if you put whatever you damn want in it - it’s authentic. So I’ve labelled a few things optional, and given some options as well.

## Background 
Iterated on from https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/09/how-to-cook-perfect-irish-stew-felicity-cloake
### Tldr Changelog from above:
- Flour + brown the meat
- Veg prep at start
- YEEEAHHHH GUINNESS
- Changed all mention of potatoes to the colloquially correct “spuds”. If you accidentally say “potato” instead while making, take a drink from the leftover Guinness. Likewise if you find yourself converting from correct (metric) to incorrect (imperial) measurements, take a drink.

## Serves 6
## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp oil veg/olive
- 3 large white/brown onions
- 10ish floury spuds (look up what varieties are floury in America)
- 500-600g Lean lamb/Beef chunks/dark beans(drained - black/kidney also add 100ml auqafaba for this) (Lamb is more traditional. Lamb necks are the most Beans are lyfe in a soup/stew though)
- Bitta flour to coat the meat (if you’re using meat)
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 6 carrots (optional)
- 250ml Guinness (optional - it is vegan if you’re going the beans route)

## Method
1. Peel carrots and cut into large chunks.
1. Peel four spuds, and slice thinly. (if you’re doing cutting prep ahead of time store the spuds in a bowl of water - they should be under the water to stop them from going grey)
1. Peel six spuds, and cut them into large chunks.
1. Peel and thickly slice the onions.
1. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Heat the oil in a large casserole dish over a medium flame and sweat the onions until soft and golden, but not browned.
1. Lightly coat the meat flour and brown slightly in a separate pan. Don’t cook it all the way through.
1. Take the casserole dish off the heat, tip the onions into a bowl and line the base of the pan with sliced potato (say that out loud? Take a drink). Tip the onion back into the casserole dish, along with the meat/beans+aquafaba and thyme, season generously and pour in 850ml cold water and the Guinness. Bring to a bare simmer, then cover and transfer the casserole to the oven for an hour and a half.
1. Add and stir the carrots into the pot and put the chunks of spuds on top. Leaving the lid slightly ajar, cook for another 30 minutes, by which time the meat should be very tender and the sliced spuds all but disintegrated into the gravy.
1. Taste, season if necessary and top with chopped parsley or chives. Serve with pickled red cabbage or steamed greens.
