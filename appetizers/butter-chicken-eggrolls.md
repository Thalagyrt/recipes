# Butter Chicken Eggrolls

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into cubes
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1 clove garlic, grated
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 1 pinch cayenne
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 tbsp coarsely chopped garlic
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup diced no-salt-added canned tomatoes
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 2 tbsp butter
- 8 egg roll wrappers
- 1 egg beaten
- Chopped cilantro, to garnish

## Instructions

- Start by marinating the chicken. Combine the chicken, lemon, garlic, garam masala, cayenne and salt in a large freezer bag. Massaged the bag and set aside. Let stand at room temperature while you prepare the sauce.
- Heat oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add onions and cook for 20 minutes until golden. Add garlic, garam masala, paprika and salt and sauté for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and cream and stir. Then carefully puree using an immersion blender. You can also use a stand up blender but blend in batches so the steam doesn’t pop the lid off.
- Return sauce to saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add chicken to the sauce, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Before rolling, break the chicken apart with 2 forks so it will fit into the rolls. Stir in butter, taste and add more salt to taste.
- To wrap, separate 1 sheet of spring roll wrapper and place on your board like a diamond. (Keep the remaining wrappers under a damp towel to avoid drying out). Place several pieces of chicken on the center of the wrapper avoiding too much sauce and form into a cylinder. Flip over the bottom corner to cover the chicken and then squeeze it towards you to make it tight. Fold in the sides and continue rolling away from you. To seal the final edge, place your finger in the beaten egg and rub a small amount along to edge. Roll up to seal.
- Fry at 350 for about 5 minutes. To serve, slice in half and place the remaining sauce on the side for dipping. Serve sprinkled with cilantro, if desired.
