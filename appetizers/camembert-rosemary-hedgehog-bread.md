# Camebert-Rosemary Hedgehog Bread

## Ingredients

- 1 whole camembert, packaging removed
- 1 large loaf of bread
- 3 fat cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 2 tbsps rosemary, finely chopped
- 8 tbsps olive oil
- Sea salt flakes

## Instructions

- Using the bottom of your camembert box as a stencil, cut a hole in the middle of the loaf. Tear away.
- Carefully cut your loaf so you have individual segments. 8 times along the long edge of the loaf and 3 across the short edge should serve you well.
- Turn the cheese on its side and cut the top off, trying not to take away too much ‘flesh’.
- Pop the exposed cheese face up in your bread hole.
- Mix the rosemary and garlic into your olive oil and spoon all over the loaf, encouraging the bits into all the slits. Cover the loaf liberally with salt, pop a little sprig of rosemary in the middle of the cheese and bake for 25 minutes at 330F.
- Dunk.
