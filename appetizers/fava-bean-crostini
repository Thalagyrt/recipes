# Fava Bean Crostini

## Ingredients
1 cup shelled and peeled fava beans  (this was just under 2lbs beans in pod)
1/4 cup olive oil
1 clove garlic, pressed
1/4 cup pecorino cheese
1/4 cup parmesan cheese 
salt and pepper to taste 

french baguette 
olive oil for brushing

## Instructions

To enjoy fava beans you first have to prepare them, it is like a courting ritual really.
Shuck all the beans to free them from the pod, and place them in a bowl. Boil some
water. Once all your beans are shucked plunge them in the boiling water for 3 minutes.
They will turn a whitish hue. Remove the beans from the water and plunge them in an ice
bath. Use your fingernail to scratch the skin open, then gently press out the bright green
bean inside.

In a food processor pulse the beans until they are a paste, add the garlic and the olive oil
and puree. Add the cheese and pulse. Add salt and pepper to taste. I used 1/2 teaspoon of
coarse grind salt. You may want more or less. Always add the salt after the cheese, as the
cheese is salty!

Preheat the oven to 400º. 

Cut a baguette and brush each side with olive oil. Place on a sheet pan and put them into
the oven for 4 minutes or until the bottom side gets golden. Flip and give it another few
minutes so the top is lightly golden. You don’t want the bread too crispy or it will be too
hard to bite. Ideally it will be lightly toasted on top and chewy in the center. 
Generously top each slice of bread with the fava bean puree and garnish with some grated
parmesan. You may notice that I had you finish the puree before you preheated the oven,
this is intentional. Letting the puree sit for 20-30 minutes lets the flavors mix and the
garlic come through. The puree stores well in the fridge overnight, and can also be frozen.
