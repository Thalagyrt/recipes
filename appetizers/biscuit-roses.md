# Biscuit Roses

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 tube flaky biscuit dough (or make your own)
- 1 Tbsp. minced garlic
- 1 Tbsp. minced parsley
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Preheat oven to 350˚F/175˚C.
- Flatten out 1 piece of biscuit dough.
- Spread minced garlic, parsley, mozzarella, and parmesan onto flattened biscuit dough.
- Make a small cut starting from the center of the dough to the outer edge & roll into a rose shaped biscuit.
- Pinch the edge together so the biscuit stays closed while baking. Repeat steps 2-4 until you have five roses.
- On a baking tray lined with parchment paper, arrange 4 roses into a circle, with all the bases facing in, then put the last rose on top in the center.
- Bake for 15 minutes, uncovered, then cover with a piece of aluminum foil and bake for another 5 minutes.
- Sprinkle with extra parsley and parmesan for garnish.
