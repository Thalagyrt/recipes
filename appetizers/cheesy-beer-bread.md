# Cheesy Beer Bread

## Ingredients
- Nonstick spray
- 8 ounces all-purpose flour
- 4 ounces whole-wheat flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1.5 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
- 4.5 ounces sharp Cheddar, grated
- 12 ounces cold beer, ale or stout
- 1 to 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds, optional

## Directions
- Heat the oven to 375F/190C. Coat the inside of a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with the nonstick spray and set aside.
- Whisk together the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and dill in a large mixing bowl. 
- Add in the cheese and stir in the beer to combine. 
- Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. 
- Sprinkle with the sunflower seeds, if using.
- Bake on the middle rack of the oven until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210F/93C on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 to 55 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer the loaf to a cooling rack for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving.

(NOTE: Try changing different combinations of beer and cheese to your liking. This bread also makes for a delicious sandwich.)
